**sync•gw** is the one and only fully portable server software available providing synchronization service between nearly any mobile device and your web server.

## EXPERIMENTAL: MAPI over HTTP bundle for sync•gw ##
If you want to connect your **[Outlook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlook)** installation to **sync•gw**,
then you need **Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) over HTTP** protocol.

The included files enables support for [MAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAPI). Technically the
communication between **Outlook** and your **sync•gw** installation works fine, bute unfortunately 
currently the results were poor. Due to the very poor documentation provided by **MicroSoft**, I was not able
to find out the meaning of many fields. 

## Installation ##
To install the **sync•gw MAPI bundle** please go to your web server base directory and enter

```bash
composer require syncgw/mapi-bundle
```
